</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-must-you-do-to-keep-your-e-money-account-safe">What must you do to keep your e-money account safe</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only way to access your account is your device and your payment card. Keep them reasonably safe at all times. If we discover any security issues affecting your account, we’ll contact you as soon as possible in the most secure way, using one of our usual channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must take all reasonable steps to keep your account access code and card pin secret in order to prevent unauthorized use of your TU e-money account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you think someone else knows your access code and has access to your device, you must change it as soon as you reasonably can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must tell us as soon as you can if you think someone may be using your e-money account without your permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must only use your e-money account in accordance with these terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you lose your card or see transactions in the app that look wrong, freeze your card using your TU App account and tell us as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll usually refund you any money if:<br>
a)  it was taken after you froze your card in the app, unless you acted fraudulently<br>
b)  we should’ve applied strong customer authentication but we didn’t, unless you acted fraudulently<br>
c) someone makes a payment without your permission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll also refund any money you lost due to our mistakes or inaccuracies with your payments. We can help by speaking to other payment providers to make sure they treat any payment we send late as if it was sent on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But you won’t be able to claim back money you’ve lost if: i) you gave us incorrect instructions or we can prove that the bank we sent your payment to received it (although we’ll still try to help you recover your money) ii) you purposefully didn’t keep your phone, card or PIN safe, or you were very negligent in not keeping them safe or if your account is in overdraft, you gave them to someone else you acted fraudulently; iii) If someone pays money into your account by mistake you give us permission to return it; iv) If you’ve used your card to make a payment which didn’t specify the exact amount (for example when hiring a car), and the final amount is higher than you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could reasonably have expected, we’ll give you a refund. You’ll need to tell us within 8 weeks of the transaction and give us any information we reasonably ask for to investigate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we received a payment on your behalf, but the money was not paid into your account on time, we’ll immediately credit your account with the amount of the payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always make sure you know the person you are making a payment to. If someone approaches you and asks you to make a payment to them, but you are not sure who they are or what the payment is for, you may be a victim of a scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not responsible if we make a payment to the person you tell us to, even if you gave us the wrong account number, username or phone number by mistake. However, if you ask us to, we’ll try to get your money back for you. We may also try to get you information about the beneficiary so that you can try to get it back yourself (if the law allows us to). While we will try to do these things, we don’t guarantee that we will, and in some cases we won’t be able to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although we may provide you with “confirmation of payee” services for some payments, the ultimate decision on whether to make those payments remains with you. We provide these services to help you make a more informed decision, but the information is provided by the institution holding the payee’s account, not by us, so we cannot guarantee its accuracy. This means that we, and any third parties we use to provide these services to you, are still not responsible for any payment you make to a wrong account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if you ask us to, we’ll try to get your money back for any mistaken payment. We may also try to get you information about the beneficiary so that you can try to get it back yourself (if the law allows us to). While we will try to do these things, we don’t guarantee that we will and in some cases we won’t be able to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For safety reasons, you should always check your account regularly to make sure everything is correct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-make-a-payment">How long does it take to make a payment?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We understand that when you make a payment, one of the most important things is that the person the payment is for receives it on time. When their bank will receive the money depends on what time you tell us to make the payment. More details on payments instruction can be found on <a href="https://www.mytu.co/">TU website</a>.</li>

<p>Please also bear in mind that others might impose taxes or costs on you. For example, when you use your card to pay us for a balance top-up, your card provider may charge you a fee for doing so (you can normally find out from your agreement with the provider whether that’s the case). Or, for example, other banks may charge you for sending money to your TU account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees for our services and any expenses to be reimbursed by you are available in our pricelist, which you can be retrieved via the TU website. Insofar as the fees become due, we calculate these on a quarterly basis and debit them from your account at the end of every quarter, insofar as not otherwise disclosed or stated in the price list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fees-for-making-or-receiving-payments">Fees for making or receiving payments</h2>

<p>If you don’t meet the “Price list” Criteria at the time you make the withdrawal, you can withdraw up to 200 EUR up to 2 withdrawals from an ATM in the Lithuania or the EEA in any calendar month without any fees. After that, we charge 2% (min € 2.5) of the amount you withdraw.</p>

<p><em>Some ATM vendors may apply there own (additional) charges for cash withdrawal, however they have to inform you about that in advance.</em></p>
<p>When setting up withdrawal request, You must ensure that the information You provide is correct and complete. TU will not be responsible for money sent to the wrong recipient or wrong amount as a result of incorrect information provided by You.</p>

<li>
<p>However, we may refuse your request for the refund if we can demonstrate that:<br>
a) you have acted fraudulently or unfairly; or<br>
b) the payment was not to pay for a purchase at a distance (e.g. online) and you had intentionally or with gross negligence not taken all reasonable steps to keep your TU password secret and the payment took place before you told us you thought someone was misusing your account.</p>

If we’re unable to do so, you can make a written request for us to provide you with all the information available to us which is relevant to you in order for you to file a legal claim to recover the money.)</p>

b) us meeting our obligations under European Union or Lithuanian law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a respective Notice from You or having established that the payment transaction has not been authorised by you, we will refund the amount of the unauthorised Payment Transaction without undue delay, and in any event no later than by the end of the next Business Day, and, if applicable, restore the debited e-money account to the state in which it would have been if the unauthorised payment transaction not take place except where TU has reasonable grounds to suspect fraud.
